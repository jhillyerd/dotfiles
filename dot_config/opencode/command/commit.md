description: Commit and push changes
---

Commit all staged and unstaged changes with a descriptive commit message, then push to the remote repository.

IMPORTANT: Always use `git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name>` to push changes. This ensures the local branch is properly tracked by the remote branch, even if the branch already exists on the remote.
